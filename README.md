## Better Discord Plugins
All my smaller better discord Projects. Bigger ones (like [Apate](https://github.com/TheGreenPig/Apate)) have their own Repository.
### Disclaimer:
All plugins that are in this repository, but not on the BD site, are just experimental plugins if I have an idea. Please do not make issues about them or use them at all, since they might be broken, inefficient or not finished. I might stop developing them at any time. If I find the motivation and time to work on one of them and I feel like it's ready to be published on the BD website, only then will I start maintaining it.
