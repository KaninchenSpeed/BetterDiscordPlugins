## HideEverything
A plugin that lets you hide every Plugin and Theme with one keybind. They dont simply get toggled, but rather saved which ones were turned off and then only the ones that were turned on get turned on again. That way if you have themes or plugins that are turned off, those stay off when you reveal everything again.
